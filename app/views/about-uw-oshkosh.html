        The campus community promotes enrichment and active learning with opportunities for sports and recreation, arts and culture, service learning and career building. Approximately 13,500 students benefit from the nationally recognized expertise of our faculty, a wide variety of courses and degrees offered — including 60 undergraduate majors,17 master’s degree programs and one doctoral degree (Doctorate of Nursing Practice) — and modest class sizes that foster one-on-one and collaborative learning with professors, rather than teaching assistants.
